## About Me 🌟
I'm a seasoned software engineer with **over 8 years of hands-on experience** in web application development. Specializing in frontend technologies like React and Next.js, I also dive into backend with Node.js, API integrations, and AI-driven solutions using GPT.  

From building large-scale e-commerce platforms to SaaS products and startup innovations, I've led feature enhancements, performance optimizations, and reliable deployments. My focus? Delivering user-centric designs that are not only functional but visually stunning and intuitive.  

As a designer at heart, I prioritize UI/UX improvements to create engaging interfaces, while ensuring code quality, security, and scalability as an engineer. Let's collaborate to turn ideas into impactful realities!
